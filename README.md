# World Weather Analysis
The purpose of this project is to collect and display real-time weather data across cities worldwide. In addition, a tool has been created that will allow travelers to identify potential destinations and hotels based on their desired weather conditions. 

## Vacation Search 
Cities are identified based on the temperature preferences of a specific traveler. Pop-ups have been added to each city that give additional detail on current weather conditions and possible hotel selection.
